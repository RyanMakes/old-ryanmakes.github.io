Hello! I was going to write about my excitement to play with some new tech and get some writing goals set up to succeed - but I must begin instead documenting a bug report.

In Astro.New's 'Blog' example in StackBlitz https://astro.new/blog?on=stackblitz (which seems to work, doubtful StackBlitz is Free and Open, haven't checked yet - there were two other options to investigate also)
When making edits to first-post.md, in the front-matter:

pubDate: '2024-05-27' and pubDate: '2024 05 27' emit, respectively:
May 26, 2024   and    May 27, 2024 

in the rendered blog. In Astro astro.build, the static-site-generator software I chose to explore as a blog platform today.
Of course, the very first thing I try uncovers a bug. This is my gift and my curse, and has been a vital asset in my career as a technologist.

It's likely a JavaScript problem. I can likely hunt it down and correct it.
But... Should I invest my energy in this? The VERY FIRST THING is broken. 

I understand TIME is DIFFICULT but.......

I want to focus on writing, not fixing a writing platform.
At the same time, I also want automated software forges to continuously static-host to my vanity URLs.
And I want a live-reloading web frontend authoring experience. (Looking mostly good so far)
One has to accept a certain amount of yak-shaving in such an adventure.

And this time, I'm going to work with an editor too. A human in-person editor. (Editor, add your intorduction note here when you exist)

Sigh. In order to actually contribute code to the astro project, I'm going to need to engage with the great beast Microsoft's tentacle, GitHub. Feels bad.

Instead of writing about my awesome stuff, I'm instead immediately confronted by adversarial jank. I didn't even want this to start as a technical blog! 

I opened this adventure today to document my work in SCULPTURE, and instead I'm wrestling with global-scale hateware mongers capturing and gatekeeping my communties. They enslave the unicorn with a crown for a collar, they cage the pheonix - they undermine the beauty of the Freedom and human purity of our best and brightest. And now they stand between me and contributing to this Astro project and having a nice time writing. And sharing warmth with my friends.

Every day, the world seems to ask me to compromise. My ideals, my sense of honour, justice, virtue, peace. I'm out of place, out of touch, committed to a spiritual truth that most would never recognize. Is it time to compromise for this? Another compromise.

Honestly it really rather stings. "Feed the beast, everyone else is doing it. What's wrong with you?"
How many hills can I die on?

I reluctantly make the choice to live as others do and I make a github account and I use it to sign in to stackblitz

Somehow, after signing in to save, I have been given some other web editor that is noticably more sluggish and it just feels bad oh my god why why why why

Why does it have to be shit? It was really good literally a minute ago before it helpfully loaded the github-specific integrations that janked it up. COME ON!

We are in it I guess. I enable GitHub Pages and Actions for Astro.

lol, of course, a git error.
